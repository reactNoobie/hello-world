# hello-world
Sample repository created by following GitHub guides.

Later it was turned into a round-robin 2-legged fixtures and standings generator to help us keep records for our internal FIFA 20 tournaments.
## Description
* Single page application built with raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Very basic layout and styling
* Takes some user inputs and renders some tables
## Usage
* **Don't reload the page!**
* Input teams for your tournament
* As teams are added, round-robin fixtures are automatically generated
* After games are played, update the results in the fixtures table using the inputs
* As results are added, standings table gets auto updated
* Standings table is sorted by points, then goal difference
* Win gives 3 points, draw 1, loss 0
* If new team is added, everything gets reset (results are lost, standings table becomes empty)
